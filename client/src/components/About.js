      <h3>The idea:</h3>
      <h5>
        Often, necessity is the mother of invention. Indeed, and the driving
        force for me in this project was the difficulties my peers and I faced
        at our college gaming block. We would all rush excited to the gaming
        zone but would often find it all jammed up and had to return back. This
        was a waste of time and energy both. Hence originated the idea for this
        web application. We can all now simply open this web app and check if
        it's all worth the time and enery going to the gaming zone as we can now
        get to know in advance about the current status of the game rooms.
        <br />
        <br />
        The data administrator for S-Block can now update the status of the game
        rooms if they are full or mark them available once it's all set to free
        for others.
        <br />
        <br />
        This web app saves the husstle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Enjoy!
