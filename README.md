# v-play

Demo Link: https://v-play1.herokuapp.com/

This web app is made for the students of college to view current status of games in the gaming block of college. The admin can signin & handle the status of games and add or delete them. The site is kind of static for students to get a real time update of the gaming block. This web app reduces the time to physically go and check if a student can go and play a available game in the gaming block.
